PyGoogleNews

PyGoogleNews, created by the NewsCatcher Team, acts like a Python wrapper for Google News or an unofficial Google News API.
It is based on one simple trick: it exploits a lightweight Google News RSS feed.

Data which can be scrapped are:
1)Top stories
2)Topic-related news feeds
3)Geolocation specific news feed
4)An extensive query-based search feed


When web-scraping news articles with this library, for every news entry that you capture, you get the following data points,
that you can use for data processing, or training your machine learning model, or running NLP scripts:

Title - contains the Headline for the article
Link - the original link for the article
Published - the date on which it was published
Summary - the article summary
Source - the website on which it was published
Sub-Articles - list of titles, publishers, and links that are on the same topic
